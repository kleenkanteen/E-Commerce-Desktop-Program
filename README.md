Program to mimic kijiji like trading system, including admin and messaging functionality. Made with Java and JavaFX.

This has 2 folders for 2 phases of the program, Phase 1 and Phase 2. They are separate. Phase 1 is text only and can be run with just java. Phase 2 builds upon Phase 1 with a GUI and extra features like messaging, report, multi item trade, etc, and requires scenebuilder to run if running with intellij. When I refer to this application I mean phase 2.

To get a big picture view of the program, look at the UML here: https://github.com/kleenkanteen/E-Commerce-Desktop-Program/blob/master/phase2/UML/UML2.pdf
